When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Backup purposes - cloud storage is far better in some cases.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Better logical change documentation rather than saving changes that might not have logical changes.  Testing times two.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks - cloning repositories on Github
Clones - cloning local repositories or from Github to local repositories
Branches - a branch off the master branch where code can be modified without further consequence to the master branch
